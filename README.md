Model will use Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to predict who will buy the product, and check the percentage of positive outcome of the model.

GNB is a classification technique used in Machine Learning (ML) based on the probabilistic approach and Gaussian distribution. 
Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that each parameter (also called features or predictors) has an independent capacity of predicting the output variable. 

On the end model was compared with Decision tree clasifier which is a rule-based approach to classification and regression problems. 

GNB success rate was 84% while DT was 82%. Since there is no solution for some prediction Naive Bayes will generalize over data set,and in this case make right predictions.
